# React Shooter

### Simple 3D shooter template created using TypeScript, React, ThreeJS and Tween.

This repo contains source code for simple shooter game template with basic physics, shadows and logic, which allows you to do basic movement and use the preselected weapon. 
Also contains a couple of (not so) cool animations, created using Tween.JS lib.
